            <p>The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal baffled European naturalists when they first encountered it. It is one of the few species of venomous mammals:the male platypus has a spur on the hind foot that delivers a venom capable of causing severe pain to humans. </p>
